    <h1>Inertia</h1>
    <p><a href="https://inertiajs.com/">Inertia</a> is a new approach to building single-page web apps. It is essentially some 'glue' that joins the frontend and the backend together without the need of an API. Instead of returning static templates, Inertia allows you to return Vue, React or Svelte components directly from the backend!</p>

    <h1>Vue</h1>
    <p><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> is a progressive JavaScript frontend framework designed to be flexible. The core Vue library focuses on the view layer only, and additional packages are needed for features like routing and state management.</p>
